##Examples (actual output from Faux Poe)

Within our locket was a dream, pale and vast,\n
Beulah hid within that locket in that beloved king, \n
By their maiden wandered their love, so fast, \n
Within our maiden, stalked my broken red ring.

By our love was a hall, iron and forgotten, \n
Estella wondered with our manse in that pale tomb, \n
Within her mountain slept our mountain, so begotten, \n
With that ring, dreamed their black black room.

Beside her hall was a heath, black and torn, \n
Ethel slept beside their hall by the red king, \n
In the hall was my route, so forelorn, \n
Beneath their heath, wandered her empty afraid ring.
